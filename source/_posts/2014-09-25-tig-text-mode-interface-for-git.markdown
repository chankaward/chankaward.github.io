Tig is an ncurses-based text-mode interface for git. It functions mainly as a Git repository browser, but can also assist in staging changes for commit at chunk level and act as a pager for output from various Git commands.

If you use OSX, you can easily use ``` homebrew ``` to install ```tig```, just run
```
brew install tig
```

## Usage
Just type ```tig``` under your project directory with ```git```
```
tig
```

* ```!``` to discard file changed.
* ```D``` to delete untracked files.
